#Server for my friend's console game
My friend created a game using Python and module "PyGame". He wanted to make this game online, but he has problems with implemantation of the server. I offered my help, but I didn't want program on Python, so I used my favorite C++ and Qt framework

This server accepts from the client commands like 'l', 'a' and applying changes for instances of players after what sends new information to the clients every player in JSON format. All logic for sockets are in file "players.cpp" and "server.cpp".

I'm sorry, but this friend's game isn't on GitHub, so I cannot tag this repository here for figuring out does this project work. You can trust that all works much better than implemantation of my friend on Python )
